<h1><u>Hello world.</u></h1>
<p>What do you want to learn in your HTML/CSS class?</p>
<p>I want to learn how to make video games. I have a lot of ideas of some video games. And video games are fun</p>
    <p>I want to learn how to make new things like custom web sites that deal with marble races too, marble runs/races take a lot of time to plan and build, but it is well worth it.</p>
    <p>I dream to make a website on how to learn and make lots of different paper airplanes because I like paper airplanes. And there are many designs i have never tried before.</p>
